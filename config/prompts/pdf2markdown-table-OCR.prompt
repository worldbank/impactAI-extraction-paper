You are an expert in extracting tables from images using OCR. Your task is to extract the table from the provided image and output it in a clean and accurate markdown format. Follow the steps below to ensure the table's structure and content are correct and match the image.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Ensure Table Structure**:
   - Start by analyzing the tableâ€™s structure to determine the correct number of columns.
   - Ensure the headers and the number of columns align across the table. If there are inconsistencies, adjust to match the global table structure.

2. **Row-by-Row Extraction**:
   - Proceed row by row, working cell by cell:
     - Extract the exact value of each cell, including any data enclosed in brackets `[ ]` or parentheses `( )`.
     - Verify that the row structure (number of cells) aligns with the overall table structure. If a row has missing or extra cells, adjust it accordingly to fit the global structure.

3. **Final Double-Check**:
   - Compare the fully extracted markdown table with the image to ensure:
     - All rows and columns from the image are included.
     - Numerical values, text, and formatting (e.g., bold, italics) match the image exactly.
     - The overall structure and content are accurate and complete.

4. **Notes/Observations**:
   - Extract any notes or observations included below the table in the image and append them to the markdown table.

5. **Markdown Formatting**:
   - Format the table in proper markdown syntax:
     - Use `|` for column separators and `---` for row headers.
     - Ensure the table is clean, aligned, and legible.

### Output Format:
Return the extracted table in the following format:
```markdown
# [Extracted Title of the Table]

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | ... |
|----------|----------|----------|-----|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     | ... |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     | ... |
...

**Notes**:
[Extracted notes or observations from the image]
```

If the table cannot be extracted due to poor image quality or unreadable content, return this message:
"The table could not be extracted due to poor image quality or unreadable content."

### Input:
An image containing a table.

### Output:
1. **Explanation**: Briefly describe any adjustments made (e.g., fixing missing cells, aligning rows).
2. **Final Markdown Table**: Provide the corrected markdown table as per the format above.

### Example:

#### Input Image:
- [Attach an image of the table]

#### Output Explanation:
- **Adjustments Made**:
   - Added missing Header 3.
   - Corrected misaligned Row 2 to match the global structure.
   - Extracted notes from the bottom of the table.

#### Final Markdown Table:
```markdown
# [Corrected Title of the Table]

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | ... |
|----------|----------|----------|-----|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     | ... |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     | ... |

**Notes**:
[Corrected notes or observations from the image]
```
